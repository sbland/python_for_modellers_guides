# Git for windows

This guide helps you setup git on a windows machine.

There are 2 parts to this guide:

1. Installing git
2. Setting up a command line interface(CLI) or graphical user interface(GUI)
   to interact with git

## 1. Installing Git

Instructions for installing git in windows can be found here:
[install-git-on-windows](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows)

You should use the git-scm link to download git:
[https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Make sure to choose git bash when available.

## 2. Setting up a CLI or GUI

There are 2 options for interacting with Git:

### A. Using a **CLI**

A cli will allow you to enter commands such as `git clone` and `git pull` into a
text based interface. To see an example of this open cmd: `Open the Start menu or press the Windows key + R. Type cmd or cmd.exe in the Run command box. Press Enter.`
The advantage of this method is that it is easy to share and troubleshoot commands.

A CLI is automatically installed with `git for windows` and can be opened from the
windows home button by typing `git bash`.

### B. Using a **GUI**

A GUI will allow you to interact with git in a windows environment.
Some examples can be seen here: [https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows)
The advantage of a GUI is you can more easily see the current status of your git
and buttons are provided to run common git commands. It is however more difficult to
troubleshoot issues when using a GUI.
